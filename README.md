# Mini Project

The project involves the processing and analysis of a high-resolution black-and-white image (4096 Ã— 4096 pixels, 8 bits per pixel) using MATLAB. Students are required to perform tasks such as image contrast stretching, frequency domain analysis using 2D DFT, and image size reduction with aliasing avoidance. The project also includes generating a detailed report describing the methods used, results obtained, and the corresponding MATLAB code.
